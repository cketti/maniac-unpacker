# Unpacker for MANIAC.EXE

Removes the runtime packer from the Maniac Mansion DOS executable (EGA Enhanced Version).

The executable I received when buying the game from GOG is packed using a simple 
[runtime packer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_compression). 
This application outputs an executable that should be close to the original version when given the compressed 
version.
